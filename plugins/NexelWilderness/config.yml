# The amount of retries is how much times the plugin will retry looking for the biome before giving up.
# Higher numbers could result in higher TPS (More lag)
# Lower numbers could result in not (or less often) finding the correct biome and thus giving an error.
retries: 150

# The following list contains all Biomes. The names are modified and then visible in menu's. 
# For example: 'DESERT_HILLS' becomes 'Desert hills'. Underscores become whitespaces and everything is lower-case except the first letter.
